# Custom-Dialogue-Box-Gui
## Easy, flexible dialogue box for your RPG. Please use WITH credit.
-------------------

Please note:
- This script is designed to function **on part click.** If you want to change this, simply remove the ClickDetector and all parts of the script regarding to it. Then, **replace it with the event of your choice (part touch, mouse hover, etc -- whatever floats your boat).** All events *should* function with this script.
- The GUI can be designed however you'd like, as long as the TextLabel, Frame, ImageLabel, and ScreenGui parts are all intact. In addition, all your extra decorations should be a child of the Frame.
