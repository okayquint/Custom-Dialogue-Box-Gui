# Custom Dialogue Box Gui
## Easy, flexible dialogue box for your RPG. Please use WITH credit.
-------------------

Please note:
- This script is designed to function **on part click.** If you want to change this, simply remove the ClickDetector and all parts of the script regarding to it. Then, **replace it with the event of your choice (part touch, mouse hover, etc -- whatever floats your boat).** All events *should* function with this script.
- The GUI can be designed however you'd like, as long as the TextLabel, Frame, ImageLabel, and ScreenGui parts are all intact. In addition, all your extra decorations should be a child of the Frame.
- If you want to change the names of the ScreenGui, Frame, etc, make sure you do that in the script too. Otherwise, obviously, it won't work.
- The script should be a child of a ClickDetector, which should be a child of the *Part you want the player to click for the dialogue to fire.* 
- The ScreenGui should be a child of "ReplicatedStorage".
- Please do not remove my credit at the top of the script. Otherwise, everything else is free use.

There are no other parameters, assuming that you did everything correctly. Forward any questions to my Twitter dms: [@ROBCTNIK](https://twitter.com/ROBCTNIK)

Oh, and **please remember to credit me somewhere in your game -- either as a "contributor" or a "helper" is fine.** 

Enjoy! Have fun! :)
