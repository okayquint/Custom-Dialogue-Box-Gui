# Custom Dialogue Box Gui
## Easy, flexible dialogue box for your RPG. Please use WITH credit.
-------------------

Please note:
- This script is designed to function **on part click.** If you want to change this, simply remove the ClickDetector and all parts of the script regarding to it. Then, **replace it with the event of your choice (part touch, mouse hover, etc -- whatever floats your boat).** All events *should* function with this script.
- The GUI can be designed however you'd like, as long as the TextLabel, Frame, ImageLabel, and ScreenGui parts are all intact. In addition, all your extra decorations should be a child of the Frame.
- If you want to change the names of the ScreenGui, Frame, etc, make sure you do that in the script too. Otherwise, obviously, it won't work.
- The script should be a child of a ClickDetector, which should be a child of the *Part you want the player to click for the dialogue to fire.* 
- The ScreenGui should be a child of "ReplicatedStorage".
- You don't have to remove anything "-- written like this" or "--[[written like this]]". If it's written with two hyphens in the front, the script won't run it.

There are no other parameters, assuming that you did everything correctly. Forward any questions to my Twitter dms: [@M7TTHOOPER](https://twitter.com/M7TTHOOPER)

Oh, and **please remember to credit me somewhere in your game -- either as a "contributor" or a "helper" is fine.** 

Enjoy! Have fun! :)
